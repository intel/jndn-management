# jndn-management

This project consists of tools for managing an NDN forwarding daemon (NFD). It relies on the [NDN Protocol](https://named-data.net) and its associated [client library](https://github.com/named-data/jndn). It implements the NFD management specification outlined at http://redmine.named-data.net/projects/nfd/wiki/Management. Please note that this library does not yet implement all of the commands in the management specification.

## Install
With Maven, add the following to your POM:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.intel.jndn.management</groupId>
  <artifactId>jndn-management</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version> <!-- or a specific version -->
</dependency>
```

 - __Nfdc.pingLocal(Face forwarder)__: ping a local NFD with /localhost/nfd to verify if it exists.
 - __Nfdc.getForwarderStatus(Face forwarder)__: retrieve the forwarder status information.
 - __Nfdc.getFaceList(Face forwarder)__: retrieve all connected faces.
